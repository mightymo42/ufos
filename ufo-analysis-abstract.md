# A Spatial Analysis of UFO Sightings in the Continental United States
# Abstract
The main purpose of this project was to explore how to analyze a specific type of spatial data called point-pattern data. Specifically, this project discusses the findings of a spatial analysis done on UFO sightings data from the National UFO Reporting Center. There have been a multitude of accounts of UFO sightings and alien abductions over the years, and this project focuses on finding relationships between the location of UFO sightings and variables such as time, shape of UFO, and distance to cities, air force bases, and pop culture sites. This analysis was done using the spatstat package in R. Different point pattern models were used to create estimates of the impact of the locations of the UFO sightings. Using these estimates, this project shows how UFO sightings have changed over time, when UFO sightings are more common, what UFO shapes are more common, and how air force base locations and pop culture locations impact UFO sightings.
